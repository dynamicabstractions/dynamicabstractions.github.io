            For centuries, humans have invented new representations such as languages, notations, and diagrams to externalize our thoughts and use them to conceive and develop <strong>powerful abstractions</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            They have enabled us to discover solutions to complex problems and to grasp and articulate ideas of immense complexity. 
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            Historically, however, the <strong>limitations of <i>static</i> mediums</strong> have constrained our experiences and minds to static representations and tools.
          </p>
          <p class="right-aligned">
            By entrapping us within the fixed boundaries and functionaltiies, static mediums underutilize our cognitive capabilities and hinder our progress as they cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of human thinking.
          </p>
          <p class="left-aligned">
            With AI and dynamic mediums, we can now develop <strong>dynamic representations and tools</strong>––as seen in recent works like embodied maths and reactive AR visualizations––that enable us to think, create, and communicate in more powerful ways.
          </p>
          <p class="center-aligned">
            This working group is committed to bridging this gap and propelling us into the next chapter.
